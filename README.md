## Overview

SimpleTestFramework is C++ open-source Unit Test library designed following the ideas of libraries like CATCH or LEST.

It's main goal is to provide, in addition to classical TDD features, a set of tests for :

  - IEEE precision related testing : ULP and relative error
  - Testing over array of data
  - Exhasutive and sampling test over data sets
  - A few customization points for 3rd party types
